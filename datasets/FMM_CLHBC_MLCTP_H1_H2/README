VERSION 1.0
===============================================================================

This software package includes several Matlab scripts and
auxiliary functions/utilities, which implement rule induction algorithms in the context of 
various domains (sports and non-sports). Models here are described in the following publication:
  
Multi-Level Chinese Takeaway Process and Label-Based Processes for Rule Induction in the Context of Automated Sports Video Annotation

IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics [Under review], 2013

Please cite this paper in any publications using the MLCTP package.

Package Organization and Documentation
========================================================================
To generate topologies for MLCTP - go to MLCTP_Topology_creation
folder and run MLCTP_Topology_Generator (specify alpha and gamma inside
that code (or the range of these hyper-parameters - It will generate a mat
file with a collection of topologies which either needs copying over to
this folder or adding MLCTP_Topology_creation folder as
addpath('./MLCTP_Topology_Generator'). 

Source footage files are not present in this folder due to licensing restrictions. 
However, annotated features are present in the dataset folder that could be used in 
conjunction with this code. In principle any sequential data can be presented to this 
code for rule induction. This may require minor tweaks to be made to the code. 
In the next version, I hope to make this code more generally usable on all types of 
sequential data.

Activity and MSNBC.com source datasets are available at the UCI 
repository; It's filtered version is in the dataset folder.

Example run:
Generate_Results(5,1) %for Activity dataset with Flat MM
Generate_Results(1,2) %for Badminton using CLHBC
Generate_Results(2,3) %for Tennis using MLCTP (Note, this may require generating the topologies first in "MLCTP_Topology_creation" folder (file names must be matched)
%Note, source code for running the hybrid models is available in the "Hybrids" folder

This package may require additional resources to run properly.
