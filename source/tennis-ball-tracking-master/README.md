Tennis ball tracking in a tennis match video
============================================
- University group project (2 members)
- Developed using C++ and OpenCV library
- Tennis ball is distinguished using image subtraction, colour range filtering, and motion segmentation
- Motion segmentation algorithm was implemented based on http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/Publications/papers/yan-bmvc2005.pdf
- However, our own experimentations were conducted as several dependencies were not satisfied (limited resources)
- Credits to Yan, Christmas, and Kittler from Centre for Vision, Speech, and Signal Processing in University of Surrey
